# Desktop-Voice-Assistant-in-PYTHON
This is a very basic desktop assistant created by me(Dheeraj Sharma). it can do several tasks such as playing music,opening youtube and search web browser.
I'm currently working on it to provide it a UI AND system tray icon that'll show the running status of this assistant.
